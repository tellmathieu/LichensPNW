		<h1>Macrolichens of the Pacific Northwest Introductory Dichotomous Key</h1>
		<p>This is an interactive dichotomous key that can be used to identify lichens, specifically in the Pacific Northwest, though it may help in other locations as well.</p>
		<h2>What is a lichen?</h2>
		<p>Lichens are relationships, specifically between fungi and microscopic photosynthetic partners. Think of it like a leafy mushroom. This is an obligate (required) symbiotic relationship.</p>
		<h3>Some definitions:</h3>
		<blockquote>
			<b>David Hawksworth:</b> A stable self-supporting association of a mycobiont and a photobiont in which the mycobiont is the exhabitant.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Vernon Ahmadjian:</b> An association between a fungus, usually an ascomycete but in a few cases a basidiomycete or deuteromycete, and one or more photosynthetic partners, generally green algae or cyanobacteria. In all lichens the fungus forms a thallus or lichenized stroma that may contain unique secondary compounds.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Bruce McCune:</b> An obligate mutualistic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner.

		<h2> Introductory Key</h2>
		<p>A dichotomous key is a way to identify organism in a systematic either-or way. For each step (numbered), you chose the either a or b for what matches your specimen the best. Sometimes, you may incorrectly proceed through a step, in this case you go back. You keep going through a or b until you find an acceptable genus and then species. I find that sometimes I have to go backwards, because I mis-classified a characteristic (character). Don't worry! It's normal!</p>
		<p><a href="#cite">McCune et al. (2009)</a> designed this dichotomous key based on their research in the Pacific Northwest of the US. I have used it successfully for Northern California.</p>
		<p><b>How to use this website: Read both options for each level. Click to see pictures of examples. When you think you know which option it is, you can click on the light blue box of the option (a or b). Either the next step or the key will pop up.</b></p>

			<h3>KEY A - BASIDIOMYCETES</h3>
		</div></a>
		<p>Most lichens don't belong in this category. These tend to look a lot more like mushrooms than the rest of the lichens, because they have <b>basidia</b>, which are reproductive structures that look like mushrooms or clubs.</p>
		<p>Overall, we did not go through this category, so I mostly skipped over it, but the important difference between lichen basidiomycetes and non-lichen basidiomycetes is that lichen basidiomycetes have a photobiont partner (either green algal or blue-green cyanobacteria). You're not going to find these organisms in complete darkness (like non-lichen fungi can grow).</p>

		<h4><button class="button1" onclick="javascript:hideshow2('2');">1b. Fungus an ascomycete; fruiting structures various but not mushroom-like</button></h4>
		<p>This is your most likely choice for identifying a macrolichen. This category are defined by the fact that they have asci which hold the spores, instead of the basidia. Asci are sacs that usually have an opening at the tip.</p>
		<p>Ascomycete lichens are a big category, and they have a huge range of looks and colors. They can have a leafy thallus or almost look like a tangle of branches. Here are some pictures:</p>

				<h3>KEY B - BLACKISH, GELATINOUS</h3>
				<p>Thallus gelatinous, non-stratified; non-filamentous; black to browm or dark gray, photobiont mostly blue-green</p>
			</div></a>
			<p>These lichens are jelly-like sometimes and look less leafy. If you break off a piece and look at it from the side, you're not going to see layers of different colors. Additionally, if you spray it with water, it can look more glossy than stratified, but when it's dry, it looks very dull and matte.</p>
			<p>In the field, I did not find a lot of these, and whenever I did, they tended to be black or very dark colored. Because these mostly have the blue-green photobiont cyanobacteria, you're generally not going to find these with a bright green color when wet.</p>

			<h4><button class="button1" onclick="javascript:hideshow2('3');">2b. Thallus stratified (or too finely filamentous to tell), color various; photobiont blue-green and/or green</button></h4>
			<p>These lichens have layers (stratified) when you break off a piece and look at it from the side. Most lichens I encountered in Northern California were stratified, probably because these lichens have a cortex which are almost like a lichen's skin.</p>

				<p>Here I tore a piece of the Lobaria genus and shown it wet (left) and dry (right) from the side view. Take note of the medulla (the inside white part), the cortex (skin on the top), and the photobiont layer right below the cortex. This specimen also has cephalodia, which are compartments that hold blue-green photobiont, in addition to the algal layer.</p>

				<a href="keyc.html"><div class="key" id="keyc">
					<h3>KEY C - YELLOW, ORANGE, RED</h3>
				</div></a>
				<p>These lichens are bright and often found in more populated areas. This is because yellow-orange colored lichens are often nitrophiles. Nitrogen is more plentiful in more heavily-polluted areas. This one is the one category that I readily found in my suburb. Often the thallus (the leafy body) is small and very closely appressed (attached) to the bark of a tree.</p>

				<p>The non-bright colors of lichens are most likely in this category. The interesting this about this category is that lichens look so different when they are wet vs dry. The colors in this dichotomous key generally describe what the lichen looks like dry.</p>

						<p>For this category, the lichen can attach to its substrate at a single point (but not rock) or it can be more broadly attached. If it's not easy to pull off the substrate or hard to see the underside, it is probably more broadly attached.</p>

								<h3>KEY E - STRATIFIED FOLIOSE CYANOLICHENS</h3>
							</div></a>
							<p>Cyanolichens tend to look darker, but there are some dark lichens that aren't cyanolichens. I spray the lichen and see what the color looks like. Another helpful thing is to break off a piece and look at it from the side. I think distinguishing between blue-green photobiont and algal photobiont is easier when you have them side by side.</p>

								<p>Thallus stratified, not umbilicate</p>

							<p>If the lichen has an algal photobiont, it tends to look brighter green when wet. Like with cyanolichens, the color of the photobiont is a lot more vibrant and obvious when it is wet. It's important to know that a lichen with an algal photobiont can still look brown. This took me a while to understand.</p>

	<h1>Characters</h1>	
		<h4>Apothecia</h4>
		<div class="pics2">
			<div class="pics2_p"><p>Apothecia are structures that hold ascospores. They are generally cup- or disk-shaped. Sometimes you don't see the edges, so they can be hard to recognize in that instance. Luckily though, apothecia are pretty easy to identify.</p></div>

		</div>
		<h5><a href="#cite">Source: Mathieu, 2023</a></h5>
		<h4>Isidia</h4>
		<div class="pics2">
			<div class="pics2_p"><p>Isidia are asexual reproductive structures that are often compared to fingers, but they can also be globular (circular). The important difference between these structures and others is that isidia have a cortex and they contain the photobiont.</p></div>
			<div class="pics2_img"><img src="isidia.png" alt="isidia"></div>
		</div>
		<h5><a href="#cite">Source: McCune et al., 2009</a></h5>
		<h4>Papillae</h4>
		<div class="pics2">
			<div class="pics2_p"><p>Papillae are bumps on the upper or lower surface of the thallus. What's important to note about these structures is that they are raised. They are different from psudocyphellae, because they are not a break in the cortex and often don't look that different from the cortex. They can also be confused for immature isidia. There isn't so much of a way to tell the difference, so you would have to use other characters of the lichens.</p></div>

		<h5><a href="#cite">Source: McCune and Yang, 2021</a></h5>
		<h4>Pseudocyphellae</h4>
		<div class="pics2">
			<div class="pics2_p"><p>Pseudocyphellae are breaks in the cortex. They can look like cracks or slightly convex or concave texture. They can look like pores, but they won't be dark. Also, they can eventually have soredia, at which point I don't think they are pseudocyphellae anymore.</p></div>

		<h4>Pycnidia</h4>
		<div class="pics2">
			<div class="pics2_p"><p>Pycnidia are small embedded asexual pycnospore producers. They can present as a bump and are usually darker than the thallus (like a black dot, though in the example it is red).</p></div>

		<h4>Soredia</h4>
		<div class="pics2">
			<div class="pics2_p"><p>Soredia are powdery or grainy mini lichen that have both the photobiont and the mycobiont. They look like they are bursting out of the cortex, in areas called soralia. Generally soredia is pretty easy to identify, because their vosoble texture is quite different from the cortex of the lichen.</p></div>
